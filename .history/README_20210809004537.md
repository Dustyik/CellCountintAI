GUI Description:
For our GUI, we have opted to create a web application. We have constructed our web application in the form of a game, whereby the user has to try and 
beat the predictions of the model. Given n amount of input features, the user has to try and guess the number of retweets a particular tweet will get. 
With each prediction, the mean square log error of the users guess and the models guess will be aggregated
